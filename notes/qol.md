## Quality of Life Mods

- **cloth-api**
  Shows mod configuration menu for client-side mods .
- **appleskin**  
  Shows hunger/saturation bars and food value overlays — essential for managing food more smartly.

- **nemos-inventory-sorting**  
  Adds sort buttons for chests/inventory. Clean, intuitive, and doesn't break immersion.

- **balm**  
  Library mod required by other mods (like Waystones). Doesn't affect gameplay directly but necessary.

- **framework**  
  Another core mod (dependency) for other mods to work — usually not directly visible to the player.

- **puzzles-lib**  
  Library mod for things like Surveyor and other mods. No direct effect on gameplay.
