# Performance / Functionality Mods

- **clumps**  
  Merges XP orbs together to reduce lag when lots of XP is dropped (e.g., mob farms).

- **ferrite-core**  
  Optimizes memory usage for block and item models â€” reduces RAM footprint significantly.

- **distanthorizons**  
  Adds dynamic LOD (Level of Detail) for chunks far away, allowing insane render distances without destroying performance.

- **modflare**
  Create a cloudfare tunnel using a bundled client `cloudfared`. The servers must contain TXT record entry "cloudflared-route=play.endor-mc.online", and a DNS entry to resolve `play.endor-mc.online` that points to the tunnel.
